Gym Management System in C++ â€“ Detailed Overview
A Gym Management System is a software solution designed to automate and manage the day-to-day operations of a gym. In a basic implementation using C++, the system can manage tasks such as adding gym members, recording membership details, tracking payments, and checking membership status. This system helps gym administrators efficiently manage members and their activities.

Features of the Basic Gym Management System:
Add New Members: The system allows users to enter member details such as name, age, membership type, and payment status.
Display Member Information: The system can display the stored information of each member.
Check Membership Status: It can track the validity of membership based on payment history or expiration date.
Payment Tracking: The system keeps records of payments made by each member and alerts for pending dues.
Program Structure:
Member Structure: We will create a struct to hold the member details.
Functions:
addMember(): Takes input from the gym administrator to store member information.
displayMember(): Displays the details of a member.
checkPaymentStatus(): Checks if the member's payment is up to date.
listMembers(): Displays all registered members.
Explanation of the Code:
Member Structure: The Member structure contains fields such as id, name, age, membershipType, and paymentStatus (whether the member has paid or not).
addMember(): This function takes inputs for all member attributes and stores them.
displayMember(): This function prints the details of a member.
checkPaymentStatus(): This function checks if the member has paid their dues and displays the corresponding message.
listMembers(): This function lists all the members currently stored in the system.
Key Features:
Membership Management: The program can handle up to a limited number of members (in this case, 10).
Payment Tracking: The system allows for easy tracking of payment status for each member.
User-Friendly Menu: The system provides a simple menu interface for adding, displaying, and checking member information.
Possible Enhancements:
File Storage: You could extend this system to store member information in a file for persistent data storage.
Membership Expiry: Implement a feature to check if a membership has expired based on the joining date.
Search and Update: Add functionality to search for members by name or ID and update their details.
Conclusion:
This Gym Management System in C++ provides a basic yet effective tool for managing gym members and their payment status. It can be further enhanced by adding features like file handling, reporting, and tracking membership expiry. This program offers a foundational structure for building a more comprehensive gym management solution.
